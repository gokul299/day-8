a) Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a String representing the title of the movie, a String representing the studio, and a String representing the rating as its arguments, and sets the respective class properties to these values.

class movie {
    constructor(title,studio,rating) {
        this.movie=title;
        this.studio=studio;
        this.rating=rating;
    }
}
movie = new movie("Titanic","FOX","PG13");
console.log(movie)
b) The constructor for the class Movie will set the class property rating to "PG" as default when no rating is provided.

 class movie {
    constructor(title,studio,rating="PG") {
        this.movie=title;
        this.studio=studio;
        this.rating=rating;
    }
}
movie = new movie("Titanic","FOX");
console.log(movie.rating);

c) Write a method getPG, which takes an array of base type Movie as its argument, and returns a new array of only those movies in the input array with a rating of "PG". You may assume the input array is full of Movie instances. The returned array need not be full.
 
class movie {
    constructor(title,studio,rating) {
        this.movie=title;
        this.studio=studio;
        this.rating=rating;
    }
}
movie1 = new movie("Titanic","FOX","PG14");
movie2 =new movie ("Avengers","MARVEL","PG13");
movie3 = new movie ("spiderman","MARVEL","PG11")

console.log(movie2)
d) Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Movie with the title “Casino Royale”, the studio “Eon Productions”, and the rating “PG­13”
 
class movie {
    constructor(title,studio,rating) {
        this.movie=title;
        this.studio=studio;
        this.rating=rating;
    }
}
movie = new movie("Casino Royale","Eon Productions","PG13");
console.log(movie)
3. Write a “person” class to hold all the details
 class Person{
    constructor(name,phoneno,Email,address){
        this.name=name;
        this.contact=phoneno;
        this.mail=Email;
        this.address=address;
    }
}
person=new Person("Gokul",9234623454,"gokul@gmail.com","coimbatore");
console.log(person)



4. write a class to calculate uber price. 

class uberPrice {
    constructor(quantity,price) {
        this.no = quantity;
        this.price = price;
    }
    get total () {
        return this.no * this.price;
    }
}
const t = new uberPrice(2,100);
console.log(t.total);
